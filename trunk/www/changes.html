<li> <b>08/15/2010</b>: Version 3.3.3 released:<br />
	      	This version contains 2 bug fixes including a major one. It is highly recommended to upgrade to this version.<br /><br />
	      	There was an issue in the hashcode generation, which causes the bundle to be reloaded even if the bundle content didn't change.
	      	This implies some performance penalties.<br />
	      	The hashcode was based on the Java object ID instead of the bundle content.<br />
	      	The consequences are :
	      		
<ul>
	      			
<li>If you restart your application server, for the same application, Jawr could generate different hashcodes for the same bundle.</li>
	      			
<li>If you are using load balancing and run the same application on 2 servers, they could generate different hashcodes for the same bundle.</li>
	      		</ul>
	      	<b>Fixed issues: </b>
	    	 
<ul>

<li> <b>06/29/2010</b>: Version 3.3.1 released:<br />
	      	This version contains a lot of new features and bug fixes.<br /><br />
	      	<b>New features: </b>
	    	
<ul>
      		 
<li>
      		 	One of the big new features of this release is the ability to define variant bundles.
      		 	A variant bundle is the generalization of what already exists for the locale aware bundle.
      		 	A variant bundle is a bundle which can change depending on some defined criteria.
      		 	This means for example that you can define a specific bundle content by browser type. You can define a specific bundle for IE, and for the same bundle sent another content to Firefox, Chrome, Opera...
      		 	For more information about the variant bundle, please check the following <a href="./docs/variant_bundle.html">variant bundle documentation</a> for more detail.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	One of the feature derived from the use of variant bundle is the support for CSS bundle skin.
      		 	Jawr allows you to define CSS bundle, where the skin variant will be sent back to the user depending on the skin
      		 	used by the user. The user skin is defined in a cookie.
      		 	The good news is that the CSS skin can also be combined with the user locale, which means that Jawr is able to
      		 	sent to the user the CSS bundle depending on the user skin and also depending on the user locale.
      			For more information about how to use the new skin feature, please check the following <a href="./tutorials/howToUseJawrCssSkin.html">Jawr skin documentation</a> for more detail.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	The Jawr CSS tag has been updated to be able to generate title and alternate attributes for CSS bundles.
      		 	The Jawr CSS tag has also been updated to be able to generate alternate for CSS skin bundles.
      		 	Look for the CSS tag at the <a href="./docs/taglibs.html">tag library doc</a> for extra info.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	The Jawr skin swicther javascript generator has been created to generate the javascript file for the skin switcher.
      		 	You can take a look to the <a href="./docs/generators.html">generators documentation</a> for more info.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr now supports base64 image encoding.<br />
      		 	Jawr is now able to generate base64 encoded image in your CSS bundle using a new postprocessor.<br />
      		 	Please check the tutorial on <a href="./tutorials/howToUseJawrToGenerateBase64Image.html">how to use Jawr to generate base64 image in CSS bundle</a> for more detail.
      		 	<br />
      		 	The Jawr image tags have been updated to be able to generate base64 encoded image. 
      		 	Please check the documentation on the <a href="./docs/taglibs.html">taglib description</a> for more detail.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr supports hashcode bundle generator. This means that you can now define your own implementation of the id used to identify the bundle.(Ex: application version based, ...) 
      		 	For more detail, about how to implement your own hashcode bundle generator, take a look at the documentation about <a href="./docs/hashcodeBundleGenerator.html">hashcode bundle generator</a>.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr provides also an MD5 hashcode bundle generator, which use MD5 to create the bundle hashcode. Take a look at the documentation about <a href="./docs/hashcodeBundleGenerator.html">hashcode bundle generator</a>.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr introduces the <b>strict mode</b>. For earlier version, Jawr didn't take in account the hashcode of the requested bundle.<br />
      		 	This means that if a user request a bundle, for which the hashcode is different from the current one, Jawr will sent back the current bundle.<br />
      		 	This may be an issue if you are using an application on a clustered environment. If you deploy a new version of your application on one server,
      		 	while the other is still up. You can face cases where the user request a page on one server, and try to retrieve the web resource bundles one another.<br />
      		 	This may lead to strange behaviors.<br />
      		 	To overcome this issue, Jawr introduces the <b>strict mode</b>. In this mode, Jawr will allow you to define how you want to handle such requests by defining your own <b>IllegalBundleRequestHandler</b>.
      		 	Jawr also provides a default implementation whch returns a &quot;404&quot; if it receive a such request.  
      		 	Take a look at the documentation about <a href="./docs/illegalBundleRequestHandler.html">strict mode and illegal bundle request handler</a>.
      		 	Jawr provides just a default implementation, if you want to contribute and share your own implementation with the community,
      		 	feel free to create and attach a patch in the issue tracker. 
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr supports composite bundle postprocessors for bundle and for the unitary files.<br />
      		 	You can take a look to the <a href="./docs/postprocessors.html">postprocessors documentation</a> for more info.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr uses now alphabetical ordering for bundle resources by default.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Jawr supports media keyword in CSS Import PostProcessor. Please check the <a href="./docs/postprocessors.html">CSS import postprocessor documentation</a> for more detail.
      		 </li>
      		  
<li>
      		 	Jawr introduce a new postprocessor to combine CSS media. Please check the <a href="./docs/postprocessors.html">CSS combine media postprocessor documentation</a> for more detail.
      		 	Thanks to Gerben Jorna for the implementation of this feature.

<li> <b>12/09/2009</b>: Version 3.2 released:<br />
	      	A serious security issue has been found in Jawr when using the property <b>jawr.debug.overrideKey</b>, which allowed a user to access the content of the WEB-INF folder, and any file of your web application
	      	if the user finds the value of the property <b>jawr.debug.overrideKey</b>, which is defined your configuration file. <br />
	      	This issue is fixed in this new version. <br />
	      	<br />
	      	We highly recommend you to switch to this new version or at least to remove this property from your configuration file if you want to stay with a previous version.
	      	The recommended way to switch your current session from production to debug, is to use the JMX feature of Jawr. Please check the <a href="./docs/jmx_support.html">JMX documentation</a> for more detail.
	      	<br />
	      	For those, who have created their own resource generator, we recommend them to look at the security issue section of the <a href="./docs/generators.html">generator documentation</a><br /><br />

<li>
      		 Jawr supports the generation of CSS image sprites. Jawr uses <a class="externalLink" href="http://csssprites.org/">smartsprites</a> for the sprite generation.
      		 Thanks to Stanislaw Osinski, smartsprites creator, for his help on the integration of Jawr with smartsprites.<br />

<li>
      		 Jawr now provides a new property named <b>dependencies</b>, which allows the user to define the dependencies for a bundle.
      		 Thanks to kgray for the original idea.<br />
      		 Please check <a href="./docs/custom_bundles.html">the bundle definition document</a> for more detail.

      		 Please check <a href="./docs/global_preprocessors.html">the global preprocessor document</a> for more detail.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 Jawr has introduced a new feature to overcome in <b>debug mode</b> the IE limitation, which can only handle 30 stylesheets in one page.<br />
      		 This is particularly usefull for user which have CSS bundles in one page, containing more than 30 stylesheets.    
      		 The new property <b>jawr.debug.ie.force.css.bundle</b> has been added for this purpose.
      		 If you set this value to true,  in debug mode with an IE browser, Jawr will reference each CSS bundle as a unique CSS resource, instead of referencing all the resources of the bundle. 
      		 Please check <a href="./docs/descriptor_syntax.html">descriptor syntax doc</a> for more detail.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 The property <b>jawr.css.image.classpath.use.servlet</b> has been renamed to <b>jawr.css.classpath.handle.image</b>.

	    	<b>New features/ fixed issues: </b>
	    	 
<ul>    	 	
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	Jawr is now able to handle images. This means that all images managed by Jawr will be cached in the browser as the other Javascript and CSS resources.
	      		 	By default all CSS images will be handled by Jawr if the Jawr image servlet is defined. 
	      		 	Look for the <i>Jawr image handling</i> section in the <a href="./docs/servlet.html">servlet docs</a> and at <i>jawr.image.resources</i> in the <a href="./docs/descriptor_syntax.html">descriptor syntax docs</a> for extra info.<br />
	      		 	Two new tags have been added to the tag library to handle these images. Look for the image tags at the <a href="./docs/taglibs.html">tag library doc</a> for extra info.
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	Jawr supports now JMX, which means that you will be able to modify at runtime the behaviour of Jawr using a JMX console.
	      		 	For example, you will be able to pass from production mode to debug mode an entire application or only one session at runtime.
	      		 	Look at the <a href="./docs/jmx_support.html">JMX support doc</a> for extra info.
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      			A new &quot;bundle preprocessing&quot; feature has been added in Jawr. This feature is also known as &quot;build time bundle processing&quot;.
	      			This feature allows the user to skip the bundling process at server start-up, and use instead the data of preprocessed bundles. 
	      			Look at the <a href="./docs/bundle_preprocessing.html">bundle preprocessing documentation</a> for extra info.
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	We have also created a <b>maven plugin</b> and an <b>Ant task</b> to integrate the new bundle preprocessing feature in the project build phase.  
	      		 	Look at the <a href="./docs/jawr_ant_task.html">Jawr Ant task docs</a> and the <a href="./docs/jawr_maven_plugin.html">Jawr maven plugin docs</a> for extra info.<br />
	      		 	Thanks to Andreas Andreou for the original idea of the maven plugin.    
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	We have also decided to provide a better support to usage of CDN in Jawr. <br />
	      		 	The new property <i>jawr.url.contextpath.ssl.override</i> allows you to define what the CDN URL to use for HTTPS requests is. <br />
	      		 	In debug mode, it is now possible to reference the debug resource files deployed on the CDN. To enable this feature, you will have to set to true, the property 
	      		 	<i>jawr.url.contextpath.override.used.in.debug.mode</i>. <br />
	      		 	Look for these properties in the <a href="./docs/descriptor_syntax.html">descriptor syntax docs</a> for extra info.    
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	The property <i>jawr.css.imagepath.override</i> which defined the override path for CSS images has been removed.
	      		 	Now for CSS images, Jawr generates URLs which are relative to the CSS bundle even if the resource is deployed on a CDN. 
	      		 	Look at the <i>jawr.css.imagepath.override</i> section at the <a href="./docs/bundle_preprocessing.html">bundle preprocessing doc</a> for extra info.    
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	For a better support of CDN, Jawr provides resources which can be integrated more easily in CDN. These files are generated using the bundle preprocessing feature. 
	      		 	It even provides a rewrite configuration file for Apache server.
	      		 	Look at the <i>CDN support</i> section at the <a href="./docs/bundle_preprocessing.html">bundle preprocessing doc</a> for extra info.    
	      		 </li>
	      		 
<li>
	      		 	Jawr is now able to discover automatically the locales available for message resources.
	      		 	So the use of the bundle property <i>jawr.js.bundle.[name].locales</i> is no more necessary.
	      		 	Look for <i>jawr.js.bundle.[name].locales</i> at <a href="./docs/descriptor_syntax.html">descriptor syntax doc</a> for extra info.

<li> <b>5/31/2009</b>: Version 2.8 released:<br />
    	<b>New features/ fixed issues: </b>
    	 
<ul>    	 	
      		 
<li>
      		 	While until now it has been possible to load CSS from the classpath, images referenced in them would not be resolved. Now the 
      		 	Jawr servlet can be used to serve images from the classpath as well, thus enabling fully the ability to serve styles and related
      		 	images from jar files.  Look for <i>jawr.css.image.classpath.use.servlet</i> at the  
      		 	<a href="./docs/servlet.html">servlet docs</a> for extra info.    
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	The classpath resource generator now allows to use the <i>jar:</i> prefix to map css (it used to be <i>jar_css:</i> for
      		 	css, now the syntax is the same for both js and css files).   
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      			It is possible to request debug debug mode for a page in production mode. The purpose is to be able to have a javascript 
      			debugging session in a deployed application. The bundle members will be requested sepparately as if Jawr were in debug mode 
      			easing debug operations without having to redeploy. This is done by adding a special request parameter which is defined in 
      			configuration.  Look for <i>jawr.debug.overrideKey</i> at the  
				<a href="./docs/modes.html">debug and production modes documentation</a> for extra info.    
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	A new way to force a refresh of all bundles has been added. A secret parameter name is defined in configuration using the key 
      		 	<b>jawr.config.reload.refreshKey</b>, and whenever a request that matches the Jawr servlet includes it, the configuration
      		 	wil be reloaded.  Look for <i>jawr.config.reload.refreshKey</i> at the  
				<a href="./docs/servlet.html">servlet docs</a> for extra info.    
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Orphans search and auto bundle generation can now be disabled for convenience using a new configuration parameter named 
      		 	<b>factory.use.orphans.mapper</b>. It is on by default but when set to false orphans will no longer be searched for.     
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 	Bundles can now be defined with an alternate static URL to use in production mode. This is useful for instance to use publicly 
      		 	served libraries (e.g. the YUI framework) while still using locally served files in development mode.  Details can be found at
      		 	at the <a href="./docs/custom_bundles.html">bundle definition documentation</a>, check out the <i>productionURL</i> param.

      		 </li>

      	This release includes features and fixes by a new commiter, <b>Ibrahim Chaehoi</b>, who had already submitted patches

<li>
      		 Jawr now supports jawr.url.contextpath.override that begin with: //.  This is a protocol relative url 
      		 structure. It's handy when you are sharing your css and/or js with different domains and protocols.  
      		 So these // urls will work relative to http and https. 
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 Added jawr.css.imagepath.override property to allow for css url replacement that supports absolute URLs or 
      		 really anything you would like prepended to the URL.  This is usefull if you are sharing your css 
      		 across multiple domains and use background images.
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 Classloading has been improved to better support the 18n messages generator, which failed to load 
      		 properties files under certain conditions. 
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 Fixed issue 49 (with no jawr.csslinks.flavor setting, style tags are ended with 'null')
      		 </li>
      		 
<li>
      		 Fixed issue 56 (incorrect path management in Spring MVC controller )
      		 </li>
			</ul>
      This release includes code from our new commiter, <b>Matt Ruby</b>. Welcome aboard!. Also, as noted 
      above, <b>Ibrahim Chaehoi</b> submitted a couple of high quality patches that were included in the 
      release. Thanks a lot Ibrahim!

<li> <b>11/23/2008</b>: Version 2.6 released:<br /> 
      		<b>New features/ fixed issues: </b>
      		 
<ul>
<li> <b>Spring MVC support added. </b> Jawr now provides a Spring MVC Controller so it can now be fully configured 
      		 through Spring's configuration mechanism. See <a href="./integration/spring.html">the manual page</a> for details. </li>
      		 
<li>The way LINK tags are rendered can now be configured. Specifically, depending on the content type you choose for your 
      		 pages, you may need the link tags to be closed differently, or even not closed at all. By default, tags will be closed as 
      		 usual (i.e. with '/&gt;'). But adding a new parameter to the properties configuration will make this behavior change. 
      		 Check the <a href="./docs/taglibs.html"> taglib documentation</a> and look for 'jawr.csslinks.flavor' for details.  </li>
      		 
<li>A new generator has been added. Now CSS resources can be retrieved from the classpath by using the 
      		 <b>jar_css</b> prefix. </li>
      		 
<li>[Issue #46] The jawr[css|js].bundle.names property is now augmentable when using ConfigPropertiesAugmenter, 
      		 as it should have from the start. </li>      		 
      		 
<li>[Unregistered Issue] Jawr does not close the outputstream nor the output writers handed by the servlet container, since 
      		 that's an illegal operation, as was pointed out by user Lance. </li>      		
			</ul>
      	</li>   
      	
<li> <b>11/9/2008</b>: Version 2.5.1 released:<br /> 
      		<b>New features/ fixed issues: </b>
      		 
<ul>
<li>[Grails, issue #26] Switched from using controllers to using a servlet: This has several advantages: it is faster, there is no 
      		 need to fiddle with the grails.mime.file.extensions property, and no controller mappings need to be added. So if you are upgrading, you 
      		 need to remove the controller mappings, reset the grails.mime.file.extensions property and then follow URL mapping instructions at the 
      		 <a href="./integration/grails.html">plugin instructions page</a>. </li>
      		 
<li>[Grails, issue #32] New grails-only implementation of the i18n messages generator that solves all previous issues. It is no longer 
      		 needed to copy properties files when deploying/running in war mode, and the previous message character encoding issues should 
      		 be gone for good. </li>
      		 
<li>[Issue #44] Added code to respond with 304 to requests having the If-None-Match header. </li>      		 
      		 
<li>Link tags are now ended with '/&gt;' as opposed to &lt;/link&gt;to improve validability. While in a perfect word 
      		there should be no closing tag at all in non-xhtml documents, this seems to be the best compromise.</li>  
      		 
<li>Fixed improper exception handling at some points where stack data was being spoiled. </li>
			</ul>
      	</li>   
      	
<li> <b>10/7/2008</b>: Version 2.5 released:<br /> 
      		<b>New features: </b>
      		 
<ul>
<li>CDN support: Jawr can be used with a CDN by setting the parameter to an absolute URL. </li>
      		 
<li><a href="./docs/generators.html">Generators API</a>: you can now write components that dynamically generate scripts or 
      		 CSS during the application startup. </li>
      		 
<li>Ability to read config the file from the filesystem: instead of reading only from the classpath, the config properties file 
      		 can now be read from the filesystem. To do it the config parameter must be prefixed with file:, followed by the absolute file path. </li>      		 
      		 
<li><a href="./integration/augmenter.html">Multiple configuration sources</a> can be used when integrating Jawr with other frameworks.</li>
      		 </ul>
      		<b>Fixed issues:</b>
      		
<ul>
<li>#31:media=&quot;print&quot; ignored when useRandomParam=&quot;false&quot; </li>
      		 
<li>#29:Contextpath override does not work with absolute URLs (see CDN support above)</li>
      		 
<li>#19:PropsFilePropertiesSource.configChanged() doesn't work on Tomcat (now properties can be read from the filesystem)</li>
      		 
<li>Also, a new version of the DWR 3 has been published, fixing the latest incompatibilities. </li></ul>
      	</li>   
      	
<li> <b>7/7/2008</b>: Version 2.4.2 released:<br /> 
      	A performance improvement has been added: buffering is now used when using writers. Thanks to Richie for submitting a patch. <br />
      	There was a bug causing CSS URLs to be broken when using the static pages resource includer, which is now fixed. 
      	</li>   
      	
<li> <b>6/16/2008</b>: Version 2.4.1 released:<br /> 
      	A bug was introduced in the last release which kept DWR 2 from working with Jawr. This release fixes that bug. <br />
      	Also, a new interface has been added which ConfigPropertiesSource custom implementations can use to get access to the servlet 
      	context. The class is named net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.factory.util.ServletContextAware. 
      	
      	</li>      
      	
<li> <b>6/16/2008</b>: Version 2.4 released:<br /> 
      	<b>Jawr can be used in plain HTML pages</b>: This has been a major drawback for Jawr, since many times applications are a mix of 
      	static HTML and dynamic pages. <a href="./docs/plain_html.html"> Click here to find out how this has been solved. </a>     
      	</li>      
      	
<li> <b>6/9/2008</b>: Version 2.3 released:<br /> <b>Commons Validator integration</b>: Users of Struts and other libraries 
      	supporting the Commons Validator can now have the static and dynamic scripts added to bundles, minified and compressed with Jawr.  
      	<br /><b>DWR 3 support: </b> Jawr now supports the upcoming version 3 of the DWR framework. 
      	<br />	
      		Locale bundles can now be used as part of composite bundles. 
      	<br />				      	
				Several bugs were fixed: 
				
<ul>
<li> Grails i18n messages encoding fix. </li>
				
				
<li> i18n messages replacement was not working properly. </li>
				
				
<li> i18n bug in mappings (parameters were parsed incorrectly). </li>
				
				
<li> Bug with 'dwr:_**' mapping in debug mode. </li></ul>
      	</li>
      	
<li> <b>6/2/2008</b>: Version 2.2 released:<br /> <b>DWR integration</b>: DWR users can now leverage the new integration with Jawr, 
      	which allows bundling all DWR resources along with other static scripts. <br />
      	<b>Mapping of classpath resources: </b> bundles can now map to  resources (javascript and CSS) which are available in the classpath. 
      	<br />				      	
				Also, several bugs were fixed: 
				
<ul>
<li> bug in i18n message generation: was failing when a dollar sign was found in a message. </li>
				
				
<li> bug for i18n messages: in debug mode, would get 404s if the mapping was not set to attend *.js requests. </li>
				
				
<li> bug in CSS link rewriter, which failed when Jawr mapping had several subdomains. </li>
				
				
<li> Decreased logging verbosity of the ConcurrentCollectionsFactory. </li></ul>
      	</li>

      	
<li> <b>5/19/2008</b>: Version 2.1 released: <b>i18n messages mapping from java ResourceBundles to javascript:</b> 
      	your internationalized messages that you keep in properties files can be easily converted into a script that allows for easy access to 
      	every message and supports variable substitution. According tho the user's locale, the script generated will correspond to his language.   
      	<br />Other than that, mostly internal changes and bugfixes. The internal changes include a new system to 
      	map to Generators. These are java components which generate javascript/CSS, or read it from a different place than the usual WAR directories.
      	This opens interesting possibilities for the near future. 
      	</li>
      	
<li> <b>4/5/2008</b>: Version 2.0 released: new automatic prefixing system, conditional comments support, grails and facelets 
      	plugins, YUI compressor... Check the <a href="./docs/changes_20.html">what's new in 2.0 page</a> for a description of all the new features and fixes.
